Sacrifice Guide:

Sacrificing a card allows you to transfer one of its attributes 
(sigil, cost, power, or health) to another card, enhancing your 
deckâ€™s capabilities.

Select a card from your deck to sacrifice. Note that you will 
lose one of this card permanently. Decide which attribute of the sacrificed 
card you want to transfer to another card.
