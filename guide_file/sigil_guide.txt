Sigil Guide: 

Sigils are special abilities that are attached to your cards, 
enhancing their effectiveness in battle. Each sigil provides a unique 
strategic advantage. Since you can only use one card sigil during your 
turn, choosing the right one based on the situation is crucial.

Available Sigils:

Bioluminescence: Enhances itself and other abyssal fish cards, 
giving them +1 to their stats.

Swarm: Summons additional copies of itself.

Frenzy: This sigil significantly increases your offensive power by 
allowing a card to deal double its normal damage when low.

Barrier: Blocks the next attack against the card that has this sigil.

Echolocation: Allows you to see the upcoming attack.

Swift: 50% chance to avoid attack.

Shell: Choose a villian's card to cut the damage in half.
