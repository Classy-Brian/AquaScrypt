Upgrade Guide:

Upgrading your cards is an essential part of becoming stronger 
and more resilient in your journey. When you visit the upgrade 
point, you can improve a cardâ€™s power or health, giving you a 
strategic edge in battles.

Upgrade Process: You will be prompted to choose one of your cards 
to upgrade. The selected card, and other card with the same name
will receive either a power or health boost.

Guaranteed First Upgrade: After selecting a card, the type of upgrade 
is determined randomly. The first upgrade is guaranteed to succeed

Optional Additional Upgrades: After the initial guaranteed upgrade, 
you have the option to attempt another upgrade. This decision is 
risky and involves a halving success chance starting from 50% and 
keep reduces the success chance by half for each upgrade. If you're
unlucky then you will loss all you cards with the same name. Are you
lucky?
